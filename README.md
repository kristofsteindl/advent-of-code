# advent-of-code
Implementation and solution for advent of code https://adventofcode.com/, an annual coding challenge
Since these are language independent problems, the challenge was to find the right algorithm. 
You can find multidimensional array processing in CubeInitiator (day17), various usage of streams and Collection framework in AllergenFinder (day21).
Recursion is used for many solutions, for example OperationEvaluator (day18) or CardCombat (day22).
You can even find example for java abstraction and inheritance in OperationEvaluator (day18).
There are lightweight puzzles, like MemoryChallenge (day15), and puzzles that require plenty for-loops and other boiler-plate code like in ImageReconstruator (day20).
