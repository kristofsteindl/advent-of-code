# advent-of-code
Implementation and solution for advent of code annual coding challenge (https://adventofcode.com/)
Due to these are a language independent problems, finding the right algorithm was the challange. 
You can find multidimensional array processing in CubeInitiator of day17, various usage of streams and Collection framework in AllergenFinder of day21.
Recursion is used for many solution for example OperationEvaluator of day18 or CardCombat of day22.
You can even find example of java abstraction and inheritance in OperationEvaluator of day18.
There are lightweight puzzles, like MemoryChallange of day15, and puzzles that require plenty for-loops and other boiler-plate code like ImageReconstruator of day20.
